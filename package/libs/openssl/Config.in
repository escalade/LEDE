config OPENSSL_OPTIMIZE_SPEED
	bool

	prompt "Enable optimization for speed instead of size"
	select OPENSSL_WITH_ASM
	help
		Enabling this option increases code size (around 20%) and
		performance.  The increase in performance and size depends on the
		target CPU. EC and AES seem to benefit the most, with EC speed
		increased by 20%-50% (mipsel & x86).
		AES-GCM is supposed to be 3x faster on x86. YMMV.

config OPENSSL_WITH_ASM

		Disabling this option will reduce code size and performance.

		Elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC) is an approach to public-key

		ChaCha20-Poly1305 is an AEAD ciphersuite with 256-bit keys,

		The default openssl preference is for AES-GCM before ChaCha, but
		that takes into account AES-NI capable chips.  It is not the
		case with most embedded chips, so it may be better to invert
		that preference.  This is just for the default case. The
